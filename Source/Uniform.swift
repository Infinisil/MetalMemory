/**
Acts as a cheap view onto a MTLBuffer as a single item of type T.

This class encapsulates the allocation (and deallocation) of the necessary memory to store a single value of type T. If the device (MTLDevice) is set or updated, a MTLBuffer is created on that device using the memory used to store the value of type T. Note that upon updating the device, no memory is moved, only the buffer is updated. This means that the memory used to store the value exists as long as the instance of this class isn't deallocated.

The `MTLResourceOptions` used to create the `MTLBuffer` are `.StorageModeShared` and `.CPUCacheModeDefaultCache`. The `offset` property will always return `0`. Note that the amount of allocated bytes is `sizeof(T)` rounded up to the next page-multiple. If no value is given initially, the memory is initialized to all zeros. Setting and getting calls to the `value` property have no overhead, since it's just using the direct pointer to the memory and inlining the call.


Example usage:

```swift
let int = Uniform(value: 10)
int.device = metalDevice
int.value += 1
commandEncoder.setMemory(int, atIndex: 0)
```
